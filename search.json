    "text": "Abstract\nThis is a dummy abstract, dreamt up by chatGPT. Chromatin organization plays a crucial role in gene regulation and genome stability, particularly during the complex process of spermatogenesis. This thesis explores the three-dimensional chromatin architecture of the X chromosome in baboons, macaques, and humans, with a specific focus on the role of chromatin compartments during spermatogenesis. Leveraging publicly available Hi-C data, interaction maps were generated to identify Principal Component 1 (PC1) compartments, revealing distinct chromatin compartmentalization patterns across species. The analysis was extended to examine transition zones, areas where chromatin shifts from one compartment type to another, and their correlation with regions under positive selection.\nBy comparing these zones with regions of known evolutionary significance, the study aims to uncover how chromatin structure reflects and potentially drives evolutionary pressures. A key finding is the identification of conserved chromatin features that may contribute to the retention of non-advantageous alleles, suggesting a possible role for selfish genetic elements in shaping genome evolution. The results of this research provide novel insights into the interplay between chromatin architecture and evolutionary dynamics, contributing to a deeper understanding of the conservation and divergence of chromatin structures across primate species.",

This spatial information helps in correctly assembling contigs into chromosomes by providing contacts between distant genomic regions, thus resolving ambiguities in the linear sequence data. Thus, Hi-C data is often available, and leveraging this existing data can provide valuable insights to other areas without the need for additional sequencing. The aim of this project is to analyze chromatin compartments on the X chromosome during spermatogenesis in baboons, macaques, and humans using Hi-C data. The project involves generating interaction maps and identifying PC1 compartments. A key objective is to compare transition zones with regions undergoing positive selection to uncover how chromatin architecture reflects evolutionary pressures. The ultimate goal is to deepen our understanding of chromatin organization and the conservation of non-advantageous alleles, providing insights into the role of selfish genes in shaping genome evolution.",

    "text": "Notes on litterature as I read it\n(Wang et al. 2019) Macaque/Mouse Hi-C paper. They use HiC-Pro and incorporates RNAseq data analyzed by TopHat and CuffLinks. Introduce small-scale in situ Hi-C (sisHi-C). They analyze both A/B compartments and TADs. Also introduce ‘Refined A/B compartments’ with ‘Local PCA’. They cite (Servant et al. 2015) for their PCA method.\n(Servant et al. 2015) describes the software HiC-Pro. Is a pipeline for all the steps until analysis of the contact maps. Includes (iterative correction) normalization steps, which is also available as standalone hiclib/iced tool. They refer to (Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009) for PCA method.\n(Lieberman-Aiden et al. 2009) Introduces the Hi-C method and some ways of analyzing the data. E.g. the eigenvector (PCA) method, where they refer back to (Price et al. 2006)\n(Price et al. 2006) use PCA to account for stratification in GWAS. The paper was cited by the Hi-C paper (2009) which was cited by the HiC-Pro paper as their PCA method. No real use for this paper, and they also refer back to a general guide on PCA from 2003. End of citation chain.\n(Zuo et al. 2021) Stage-resolved Hi-C analysis in mouse spermatogenesis, using mm10 reference genome. They use hiclib (now replaced by distiller) and cooler/cooltools from mirnylab. They focus on genome-wide chromatin structure, especially the weakening of TADs in prophase I (pachytene stage) while there is persistent CTCF binding (loops). They suggest that chromosome organization may provide an infrastructure for the modulation of meiotic recombination in higher eukaryotes.\n\nQ: Could alterations in TAD organization during specific meiotic stages create opportunities for selfish genes to proliferate or influence transmission?\n\n(Batra et al. 2020) Baboon paper. They announce a new de novo-assembled reference genome, Panubis1.0, more accurate than the previous Panu3.0, which was a highly fragmented assembly based on short-read seq-tech and reference guided assembly (ref: rhesus macaque). They made the de novo assembly by combining 10x Genomics (physically linked short-reads) with Nanopore long-reads, and finally ordering and orienting the reads with Hi-C seq. They state no specific conclusions about the Hi-C data separate from the assemmbly.\n(Shami et al. 2020) Divergent features of mammalian spermatogenesis. They use scRNA-seq to study spermatogenesis in human, macaque, mice. They compare conserved and divergent features of spermatogenesis across species. Spermatogonia, spermatocytes, spermatids. Identified a gene TSPAN33 that was expressed in primate spermatogonia populations, but not in mice. They found both conserved patterns across species and species-specific patterns, notably in genes involved in immune system and blood-testis barrier, also including signalling pathways. Identify a genetic region that may be of interest, but otherwise I don’t know how to use this paper, unless they have Hi-C data they can send us.\n(Chakraborty, Wang, and Ay 2022) dcHiC paper/dcHiC tool. Differential compartments analysis. Utilize a multivariate distance measure, Mahalanobis (opposed to only pairwise comparisons) to identify and analyze changes across multiple Hi-C maps. They found compartmental changes in regions containing genes involved in cell identity (regulating pluripottency, cell adhesion, signaling pathways) during neuronal development. dcHiC can also identify sub-compartmental changes, and integrate compartmentalization data from other datasets (gene expression, histone modification, replication timing). Multivariata seems to be a better way of considering the Hi-C data.\n(Bicciato and Ferrari 2022) Book on Hi-C data analysis. Might use to find conventional use of thresholds, etc. Might follow a couple of these pipelines if they are not already outdated.\n(Skov et al. 2023) Paper from Munch-group. Cautiously hypothesize that meiotic drive on X chr could be responsible for their observations. Examining the selective sweeps in the context of (primate) spermatogenesis could be insightful. Integrating gene expression and Hi-C maps during spermatogenesis, could potentially uncover if the sweeps preferentially affect active elements/gene during spermatogenesis at i.e. specific stages.\n(Bravo Núñez, Nuckolls, and Zanders 2018). Paper on Genetic Villains/meiotic drivers. Describes the difficulty of detecting drive, and different types of drive. Killer-Target, Poison-Antidote. They have nice illustrations of meiotic drive.\n(Gong et al. 2021) Most recent paper I could find on Hi-C in human. But it is about cancer and other omics than Hi-C.",
