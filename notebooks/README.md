# Notebooks

Notebooks are named like this: `01_name.ipynb`. Names reflect the content and that the numbers reflect the order in which the notebooks should be run.

Unnumbered notebooks are allowed if they are either *draft* or should not be run (they are not used in this analysis, really).

Python scripts are allowed for helper functions used in multiple notebooks.
