              Background
              Baboons are a widely used nonhuman primate model for biomedical, evolutionary, and basic genetics research. Despite this importance, the genomic resources for baboons are limited. In particular, the current baboon reference genome Panu\_3.0 is a highly fragmented, reference-guided (i.e., not fully de novo) assembly, and its poor quality inhibits our ability to conduct downstream genomic analyses.
            
            
              Findings
              Here we present a de novo genome assembly of the olive baboon (Papio anubis) that uses data from several recently developed single-molecule technologies. Our assembly, Panubis1.0, has an N50 contig size of ∼1.46 Mb (as opposed to 139 kb for Panu\_3.0) and has single scaffolds that span each of the 20 autosomes and the X chromosome.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We highlight multiple lines of evidence (including Bionano Genomics data, pedigree linkage information, and linkage disequilibrium data) suggesting that there are several large assembly errors in Panu\_3.0, which have been corrected in Panubis1.0.},

We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.},

            During meiosis, chromosomes exhibit dramatic changes in morphology and intranuclear positioning. How these changes influence homolog pairing, alignment, and recombination remain elusive. Using Hi-C, we systematically mapped 3D genome architecture throughout all meiotic prophase substages during mouse spermatogenesis. Our data uncover two major chromosome organizational features varying along the chromosome axis during early meiotic prophase, when homolog alignment occurs. First, transcriptionally active and inactive genomic regions form alternating domains consisting of shorter and longer chromatin loops, respectively. Second, the force-transmitting LINC complex promotes the alignment of ends of different chromosomes over a range of up to 20\% of chromosome length. Both features correlate with the pattern of homolog interactions and the distribution of recombination events. Collectively, our data reveal the influences of transcription and force on meiotic chromosome structure and suggest chromosome organization may provide an infrastructure for the modulation of meiotic recombination in higher eukaryotes.},

              The compartmental organization of mammalian genomes and its changes play important roles in distinct biological processes. Here, we introduce dcHiC, which utilizes a multivariate distance measure to identify significant changes in compartmentalization among multiple contact maps. Evaluating dcHiC on four collections of bulk and single-cell contact maps from in vitro mouse neural differentiation (n=3), mouse hematopoiesis (n=10), human LCLs (n=20) and post-natal mouse brain development (n=3 stages), we show its effectiveness and sensitivity in detecting biologically relevant changes, including those orthogonally validated. dcHiC reported regions with dynamically regulated genes associated with cell identity, along with correlated changes in chromatin states, subcompartments, replication timing and lamin association. With its efficient implementation, dcHiC enables high-resolution compartment analysis as well as standalone browser visualization, differential interaction identification and time-series clustering. dcHiC is an essential addition to the Hi-C analysis toolbox for the ever-growing number of bulk and single-cell contact maps.

Although dynamic chromatin structures have been identified in the genome, the full scope of chromatin dynamics during mammalian development and lineage specification remains to be determined. By mapping genome-wide chromatin interactions in human embryonic stem (ES) cells and four human ES-cell-derived lineages, we uncover extensive chromatin reorganization during lineage specification. We observe that although self-associating chromatin domains are stable during differentiation, chromatin interactions both within and between domains change in a striking manner, altering 36\% of active and inactive chromosomal compartments throughout the genome. By integrating chromatin interaction maps with haplotype-resolved epigenome and transcriptome data sets, we find widespread allelic bias in gene expression correlated with allele-biased chromatin states of linked promoters and distal enhancers. Our results therefore provide a global view of chromatin dynamics and a resource for studying long-range control of gene expression in distinct human cell lineages.},

            Nuclear compartments are prominent features of 3D chromatin organization, but sequencing depth limitations have impeded investigation at ultra fine-scale. CTCF loops are generally studied at a finer scale, but the impact of looping on proximal interactions remains enigmatic. Here, we critically examine nuclear compartments and CTCF loop-proximal interactions using a combination of in situ Hi-C at unparalleled depth, algorithm development, and biophysical modeling. Producing a large Hi-C map with 33 billion contacts in conjunction with an algorithm for performing principal component analysis on sparse, super massive matrices (POSSUMM), we resolve compartments to 500 bp. Our results demonstrate that essentially all active promoters and distal enhancers localize in the A compartment, even when flanking sequences do not. Furthermore, we find that the TSS and TTS of paused genes are often segregated into separate compartments. We then identify diffuse interactions that radiate from CTCF loop anchors, which correlate with strong enhancer-promoter interactions and proximal transcription. We also find that these diffuse interactions depend on CTCF’s RNA binding domains. In this work, we demonstrate features of fine-scale chromatin organization consistent with a revised model in which compartments are more precise than commonly thought while CTCF loops are more protracted.},

	abstract = {Abstract
          When germ cells transition from the mitotic cycle into meiotic prophase I (MPI), chromosomes condense into an array of chromatin loops that are required to promote homolog pairing and genetic recombination. To identify the changes in chromosomal conformation, we isolated nuclei on a trajectory from spermatogonia to the end of MPI. At each stage along this trajectory, we built genomic interaction maps with the highest temporal and spatial resolution to date. The changes in chromatin folding coincided with a concurrent decline in mitotic cohesion and a rise in meiotic cohesin complexes. We found that the stereotypical large-scale A and B compartmentalization was lost during meiotic prophase I alongside the loss of topological associating domains (TADs). Still, local subcompartments were detected and maintained throughout meiosis. The enhanced Micro-C resolution revealed that, despite the loss of TADs, higher frequency contact sites between two loci were detectable during meiotic prophase I coinciding with CTCF bound sites. The pattern of interactions around these CTCF sites with their neighboring loci showed that CTCF sites were often anchoring the meiotic loops. Additionally, the localization of CTCF to the meiotic axes indicated that these anchors were at the base of loops. Strikingly, even in the face of the dramatic reconfiguration of interphase chromatin into a condensed loop-array, the interactions between regulatory elements remained well preserved.

	abstract = {▪ Abstract  Sex chromosome drive refers to the unequal transmission of X and Y chromosomes from individuals of the heterogametic sex, resulting in biased sex ratios among progeny and within populations. The presence of driving sex chromosomes can reduce mean fitness within a population, bring about intragenomic conflict between the X chromosome, the Y, and the autosomes, and alter the intensity or mode of sexual selection within species. Sex chromosome drive, or its genetic equivalent, is known in plants, mammals, and flies. Many species harboring driving X chromosomes have evolved Y-linked and autosomal suppressors of drive. If a drive polymorphism is not stable, then driving chromosomes may spread to fixation and cause the extinction of a species. Certain characteristics of species, such as population density and female mating rate, may affect the probability of fixation of driving chromosomes. Thus, sex chromosome drive could be an agent of species-level selection.},

We used high-coverage whole-genome sequences from 225 wild baboons representing 19 geographic localities to investigate population genomics and interspecies gene flow. Our analyses provide an expanded picture of evolutionary reticulation among species and reveal patterns of population structure within and among species, including differential admixture among conspecific populations. We describe the first example of a baboon population with a genetic composition that is derived from three distinct lineages. The results reveal processes, both ancient and recent, that produced the observed mismatch between phylogenetic relationships based on matrilineal, patrilineal, and biparental inheritance. We also identified several candidate genes that may contribute to species-specific phenotypes.},

            Layers of genome organization are becoming increasingly better characterized, but less is known about how these structures respond to perturbation or shape changes. Low-salt swelling of isolated chromatin fibers or nuclei has been used for decades to investigate the structural properties of chromatin. But, visible changes in chromatin appearance have not been linked to known building blocks of genome structure or features along the genome sequence. We combine low-salt swelling of isolated nuclei with genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and imaging approaches to probe the effects of chromatin extension genome-wide. Photoconverted patterns on nuclei during expansion and contraction indicate that global genome structure is preserved after dramatic nuclear volume swelling, suggesting a highly elastic chromosome topology. Hi-C experiments before, during, and after nuclear swelling show changes in average contact probabilities at short length scales, reflecting the extension of the local chromatin fiber. But, surprisingly, during this large increase in nuclear volume, there is a striking maintenance of loops, TADs, active and inactive compartments, and chromosome territories. Subtle differences after expansion are observed, suggesting that the local chromatin state, protein interactions, and location in the nucleus can affect how strongly a given structure is maintained under stress. From these observations, we propose that genome topology is robust to extension of the chromatin fiber and isotropic shape change, and that this elasticity may be beneficial in physiological circumstances of changes in nuclear size and volume.},
