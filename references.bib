				Background. Baboons are a widely used nonhuman primate model for biomedical, evolutionary, and basic genetics research. Despite this importance, the genomic resources for baboons are limited. In particular, the current baboon reference genome Panu\_3.0 is a highly fragmented, reference-guided (i.e., not fully de novo) assembly, and its poor quality inhibits our ability to conduct downstream genomic analyses.
				Findings. Here we present a de novo genome assembly of the olive baboon (Papio anubis) that uses data from several recently developed single-molecule technologies. Our assembly, Panubis1.0, has an N50 contig size of âˆ¼1.46 Mb (as opposed to 139 kb for Panu\_3.0) and has single scaffolds that span each of the 20 autosomes and the X chromosome.
				Conclusions. We highlight multiple lines of evidence (including Bionano Genomics data, pedigree linkage information, and linkage disequilibrium data) suggesting that there are several large assembly errors in Panu\_3.0, which have been corrected in Panubis1.0.},

	abstract = {Chromosomal Mapping. The conformation of the genome in the nucleus and contacts between both proximal and distal loci influence gene expression. In order to map genomic contacts, Lieberman-Aiden et al. (p. 289, see the cover) developed a technique to allow the detection of all interactions between genomic loci in the eukaryotic nucleus followed by deep sequencing. This technology was used to map the organization of the human genome and to examine the spatial proximity of chromosomal loci at one megabase resolution. The map suggests that the genome is partitioned into two spatial compartments that are related to local chromatin state and whose remodeling correlates with changes in the chromatin state. Chromosomes are organized in a fractal knot-free conformation that is densely packed while easily folded and unfolded. We describe Hi-C, a method that probes the three-dimensional architecture of whole genomes by coupling proximity-based ligation with massively parallel sequencing. We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.},

            During meiosis, chromosomes exhibit dramatic changes in morphology and intranuclear positioning. How these changes influence homolog pairing, alignment, and recombination remain elusive. Using Hi-C, we systematically mapped 3D genome architecture throughout all meiotic prophase substages during mouse spermatogenesis. Our data uncover two major chromosome organizational features varying along the chromosome axis during early meiotic prophase, when homolog alignment occurs. First, transcriptionally active and inactive genomic regions form alternating domains consisting of shorter and longer chromatin loops, respectively. Second, the force-transmitting LINC complex promotes the alignment of ends of different chromosomes over a range of up to 20\% of chromosome length. Both features correlate with the pattern of homolog interactions and the distribution of recombination events. Collectively, our data reveal the influences of transcription and force on meiotic chromosome structure and suggest chromosome organization may provide an infrastructure for the modulation of meiotic recombination in higher eukaryotes.},

              The compartmental organization of mammalian genomes and its changes play important roles in distinct biological processes. Here, we introduce dcHiC, which utilizes a multivariate distance measure to identify significant changes in compartmentalization among multiple contact maps. Evaluating dcHiC on four collections of bulk and single-cell contact maps from in vitro mouse neural differentiation (n=3), mouse hematopoiesis (n=10), human LCLs (n=20) and post-natal mouse brain development (n=3 stages), we show its effectiveness and sensitivity in detecting biologically relevant changes, including those orthogonally validated. dcHiC reported regions with dynamically regulated genes associated with cell identity, along with correlated changes in chromatin states, subcompartments, replication timing and lamin association. With its efficient implementation, dcHiC enables high-resolution compartment analysis as well as standalone browser visualization, differential interaction identification and time-series clustering. dcHiC is an essential addition to the Hi-C analysis toolbox for the ever-growing number of bulk and single-cell contact maps.

Killer meiotic drivers are ultra-selfish DNA sequences that are transmitted into more than half (sometimes all) of the meiotic products generated by a heterozygote. As their name implies, these loci gain a transmission advantage in heterozygotes by destroying otherwise viable meiotic products that do not inherit the driver. We review and classify killer meiotic drive genes across a wide spectrum of eukaryotes. We discuss how analyses of these ultra-selfish genes can lead to greater insight into the mechanisms of gametogenesis and the causes of infertility.}

After that, we discuss the Hi-C data analysis methods from genome 3D structure, A/B compartment, TADs (topologically associated domain), and loop detection. We also discuss how to apply genome visualization technologies to the identification of chromosome feature structures. We continue with a review of correlation analysis differences among multi-omics data, and how to apply Hi-C and other omics data analysis into cancer and cell differentiation research. Finally, we summarize the various problems in joint analyses based on Hi-C and other multi-omics data.

We observe that although self-associating chromatin domains are stable during differentiation, chromatin interactions both within and between domains change in a striking manner, altering 36\% of active and inactive chromosomal compartments throughout the genome. By integrating chromatin interaction maps with haplotype-resolved epigenome and transcriptome data sets, we find widespread allelic bias in gene expression correlated with allele-biased chromatin states of linked promoters and distal enhancers.
