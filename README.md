# Correlating Chromatin Compartments with Selection

The GH page rendered from this repo can be accessed ![here](https://munch-group.org/hic-spermatogenesis/).

In this project, we investigate how the contact maps of High-throughput Chromatin Conformation Capture (Hi-C) can be correlated across species, and how well they correlate with regions that undergo (positive) selection.

First, we reproduce some maps from a published paper, then we make the same analysis on some new data, and compare the results. 

## Reproducing this project

This project runs in a Linux environment and may do so too on Mac. A conda environment for the project is created like this:

    conda env create -f binder/environment.yml
