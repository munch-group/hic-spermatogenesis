    "\n",
    "In this project, we formulate two objectives:\n",
    "\n",
    "**A**: Reproduce the Hi-C interaction maps and eigendecomposition from \\[@wang_reprogramming_2019\\], with some modifications. We briefly use *HiCExplorer*, but change the analyses to use the *Open2C Ecosystem* \\[@open2c\\] which have a Pyton API as well as command-line functions, which can be paired very well with Jupyter Notebooks. The majority of the data analysis was run with a *gwf* workflow, and the commands that were visually inspected were run in Jupyter Notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**B** Compare with regions of selection that are found in *papio anubis*, and maybe in *human* too. Investigate the biological meaning of the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "All computations were performed on GenomeDK (GDK) \\[ref\\], an HPC cluster located on Aarhus Uninversity, and most of the processing of the data was nested into a *gwf* workflow \\[ref\\], a workflow manager developed at GDK. I would like to thank GDK and Aarhus University for providing computational resources and support that contributed to these research results.\n",
    "\n",
    "The whole of this project is carried out with reproducibility in mind, so an effort (and quite a significant amount of time) has been put into documenting code and organizing the project for readbility and transparency through a Quarto project \\[ref\\]. Therefore, all code, virtual environments and text is made available as a Quarto book, rendered directly from the GitHub repository with GitHub Pages \\[\\]. To make this possible, the Quarto documentation has been extensively studied and discussed with *KMT* \\[ref, aknowledge\\].\n",
    "\n",
    "### Downloading Data and Project Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "To reproduce the results from \\[@wang_reprogramming_2019\\], I chose to use their raw data directly from the SRA portal \\[ref\\]. I filtered the data to contain all their paired-end Hi-C reads, and included only macaque samples. The data set also contains RNAseq data, and the same tissues for both macaque and mouse. The meta data for the data set was extracted into a runtable `SRA-runtable.tsv`. To get an overview of the data accessions used in this analysis, we will first summarize the runtable that contains the accession numbers and some metadata for each sample (@tbl-runtable-summary). It adds up to ~1Tb of compressed `fastq` files, holding ~9.5 billion reads, roughly evenly spread on the 5 tissue types.\n",

    "A flowchart showing the pipeline from `.fastq` to `.mcool`. The first 6 steps were done with a Probably BioRender or Inkscape.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The *gwf* workflow targets\n",
    "\n",
    "A *gwf* workflow was created to handle the first part of the data processing, and each accesion number (read pair, mate pair) from the Hi-C sequencing was processed in parallel, so their execution was independen on the other samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Downloading the reads\n",
    "\n",
    "The reads were downloaded from NCBI SRA portal \\[ref\\] directly to GDK using `sra-downloader` \\[ref\\] through docker \\[ref\\] as `.fastq.gz` files.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Handling the reference\n",
    "\n",
    "The latest reference genome for rhesus macaque (*macaca mulata*), *rheMac10* (or *Mmul_10*, UCSC or NCBI naming conventions, respectively) was downloaded to GDK from UCSC web servers with `wget` \\[ref\\]. To use `bwa` (Burrow Wheeler’s Aligner) \\[ref\\] for mapping, rheMac10 needs to be indexed with both `bwa index` with the `--bwtsw` option and `samtools faidx`, which results in six indexing files for `bwa mem` to use.\n",

    "\n",
    "The strategy to get the best signal was by pooling the interaction matrices. `cooler merge` was used to merge all samples in each sub-folder (cell type) to just one interaction matrix for each cell type. The reason for that is that we choose to trust @wang_reprogramming_2019 when they say that compartments are highly reproducible between replicates, and by merging all replicates, we will have a more robust signal.\n",
