Storage and computational costs mount sharply with data resolution when such maps are stored in dense form. Hence, there is a pressing need to develop data storage strategies that handle the full range of useful resolutions in multidimensional genomic datasets by taking advantage of their sparse nature, while supporting efficient compression and providing fast random access to facilitate development of scalable algorithms for data analysis.                                         Results               We developed a file format called cooler, based on a sparse data model, that can support genomically labeled matrices at any resolution. It has the flexibility to accommodate various descriptions of the data axes (genomic coordinates, tracks and bin annotations), resolutions, data density patterns and metadata. Cooler is based on HDF5 and is supported by a Python library and command line suite to create, read, inspect and manipulate cooler data collections. The format has been adopted as a standard by the NIH 4D Nucleome Consortium.                                         Availability and implementation               Cooler is cross-platform, BSD-licensed and can be installed from the Python package index or the bioconda repository. The source code is maintained on Github at https://github.com/mirnylab/cooler.

Despite this importance, the genomic resources for baboons are limited. In particular, the current baboon reference genome Panu\_3.0 is a highly fragmented, reference-guided (i.e., not fully de novo) assembly, and its poor quality inhibits our ability to conduct downstream genomic analyses.                                         Findings               Here we present a de novo genome assembly of the olive baboon (Papio anubis) that uses data from several recently developed single-molecule technologies. Our assembly, Panubis1.0, has an N50 contig size of {$\sim$}1.46 Mb (as opposed to 139 kb for Panu\_3.0) and has single scaffolds that span each of the 20 autosomes and the X chromosome.                                         Conclusions               We highlight multiple lines of evidence (including Bionano Genomics data, pedigree linkage information, and linkage disequilibrium data) suggesting that there are several large assembly errors in Panu\_3.0, which have been corrected in Panubis1.0.},

Here, we introduce dcHiC, which utilizes a multivariate distance measure to identify significant changes in compartmentalization among multiple contact maps. Evaluating dcHiC on four collections of bulk and single-cell contact maps from in vitro mouse neural differentiation (n=3), mouse hematopoiesis (n=10), human LCLs (n=20) and post-natal mouse brain development (n=3 stages), we show its effectiveness and sensitivity in detecting biologically relevant changes, including those orthogonally validated. dcHiC reported regions with dynamically regulated genes associated with cell identity, along with correlated changes in chromatin states, subcompartments, replication timing and lamin association. With its efficient implementation, dcHiC enables high-resolution compartment analysis as well as standalone browser visualization, differential interaction identification and time-series clustering. dcHiC is an essential addition to the Hi-C analysis toolbox for the ever-growing number of bulk and single-cell contact maps.

  abstract = {Abstract           When germ cells transition from the mitotic cycle into meiotic prophase I (MPI), chromosomes condense into an array of chromatin loops that are required to promote homolog pairing and genetic recombination. To identify the changes in chromosomal conformation, we isolated nuclei on a trajectory from spermatogonia to the end of MPI. At each stage along this trajectory, we built genomic interaction maps with the highest temporal and spatial resolution to date. The changes in chromatin folding coincided with a concurrent decline in mitotic cohesion and a rise in meiotic cohesin complexes. We found that the stereotypical large-scale A and B compartmentalization was lost during meiotic prophase I alongside the loss of topological associating domains (TADs). Still, local subcompartments were detected and maintained throughout meiosis. The enhanced Micro-C resolution revealed that, despite the loss of TADs, higher frequency contact sites between two loci were detectable during meiotic prophase I coinciding with CTCF bound sites. The pattern of interactions around these CTCF sites with their neighboring loci showed that CTCF sites were often anchoring the meiotic loops. Additionally, the localization of CTCF to the meiotic axes indicated that these anchors were at the base of loops. Strikingly, even in the face of the dramatic reconfiguration of interphase chromatin into a condensed loop-array, the interactions between regulatory elements remained well preserved. This establishes a potential mechanism for how the meiotic chromatin maintains active transcription within a highly structured genome. In summary, the high temporal and spatial resolution of these data revealed previously unappreciated aspects of mammalian meiotic chromatin organization.},

It states that if one sex is `absent, rare or sterile' in a hybrid population, then that sex will be heterogametic. Since Haldane first made this observation, 100~years have passed and still questions arise over how many independent examples exist and what the underlying causes of Haldane's rule are. This review aims to examine research that has occurred over the last century. It seeks to do so by discussing possible causes of Haldane's rule, as well as gaps in the research of these causes that could be readily addressed today. After 100~years of research, it can be concluded that Haldane's rule is a complicated one, and much current knowledge has been accrued by studying the model organisms of speciation. This has led to the primacy of dominance theory and faster-male theory as explanations for Haldane's rule. However, some of the most interesting findings of the 21st century with regard to Haldane's rule have involved investigating a wider range of taxa emphasizing the need to continue using comparative methods, including ever more taxa as new cases are discovered.},

Although dynamic chromatin structures have been identified in the genome, the full scope of chromatin dynamics during mammalian development and lineage specification remains to be determined. By mapping genome-wide chromatin interactions in human embryonic stem (ES) cells and four human ES-cell-derived lineages, we uncover extensive chromatin reorganization during lineage specification. We observe that although self-associating chromatin domains are stable during differentiation, chromatin interactions both within and between domains change in a striking manner, altering 36\% of active and inactive chromosomal compartments throughout the genome. By integrating chromatin interaction maps with haplotype-resolved epigenome and transcriptome data sets, we find widespread allelic bias in gene expression correlated with allele-biased chromatin states of linked promoters and distal enhancers. Our results therefore provide a global view of chromatin dynamics and a resource for studying long-range control of gene expression in distinct human cell lineages.},

CTCF loops are generally studied at a finer scale, but the impact of looping on proximal interactions remains enigmatic. Here, we critically examine nuclear compartments and CTCF loop-proximal interactions using a combination of in situ Hi-C at unparalleled depth, algorithm development, and biophysical modeling. Producing a large Hi-C map with 33 billion contacts in conjunction with an algorithm for performing principal component analysis on sparse, super massive matrices~(POSSUMM), we resolve compartments to 500\,bp. Our results demonstrate that essentially all active promoters and distal enhancers localize in the A compartment, even when flanking sequences do not. Furthermore, we find that the TSS and TTS of paused genes are often segregated into separate compartments. We then identify diffuse interactions that radiate from CTCF loop anchors, which correlate with strong enhancer-promoter interactions and proximal transcription. We also find that these diffuse interactions depend on CTCF's RNA binding domains. In this work, we demonstrate features of fine-scale chromatin organization consistent with a revised model in which compartments are more precise than commonly thought while CTCF loops are more protracted.},

The presence of driving sex chromosomes can reduce mean fitness within a population, bring about intragenomic conflict between the X chromosome, the Y, and the autosomes, and alter the intensity or mode of sexual selection within species. Sex chromosome drive, or its genetic equivalent, is known in plants, mammals, and flies. Many species harboring driving X chromosomes have evolved Y-linked and autosomal suppressors of drive. If a drive polymorphism is not stable, then driving chromosomes may spread to fixation and cause the extinction of a species. Certain characteristics of species, such as population density and female mating rate, may affect the probability of fixation of driving chromosomes. Thus, sex chromosome drive could be an agent of species-level selection.},

This technology was used to map the organization of the human genome and to examine the spatial proximity of chromosomal loci at one megabase resolution. The map suggests that the genome is partitioned into two spatial compartments that are related to local chromatin state and whose remodeling correlates with changes in the chromatin state.                        ,              Chromosomes are organized in a fractal knot-free conformation that is densely packed while easily folded and unfolded.           ,              We describe Hi-C, a method that probes the three-dimensional architecture of whole genomes by coupling proximity-based ligation with massively parallel sequencing. We constructed spatial proximity maps of the human genome with Hi-C at a resolution of 1 megabase. These maps confirm the presence of chromosome territories and the spatial proximity of small, gene-rich chromosomes. We identified an additional level of genome organization that is characterized by the spatial segregation of open and closed chromatin to form two genome-wide compartments. At the megabase scale, the chromatin conformation is consistent with a fractal globule, a knot-free, polymer conformation that enables maximally dense packing while preserving the ability to easily fold and unfold any genomic locus. The fractal globule is distinct from the more commonly used globular equilibrium model. Our results demonstrate the power of Hi-C to map the dynamic conformations of whole genomes.},

Maps of increasing size, depth, and resolution are now used to probe genome architecture across cell states, types, and organisms. Larger datasets add challenges at each step of computational analysis, from storage and memory constraints to researchers' time; however, analysis tools that meet these increased resource demands have not kept pace. Furthermore, existing tools offer limited support for customizing analysis for specific use cases or new biology. Here we introduce             cooltools             (             https://github.com/open2c/cooltools             ), a suite of computational tools that enables flexible, scalable, and reproducible analysis of high-resolution contact frequency data.             Cooltools             leverages the widely-adopted cooler format which handles storage and access for high-resolution datasets.             Cooltools             provides a paired command line interface (CLI) and Python application programming interface (API), which respectively facilitate workflows on high-performance computing clusters and in interactive analysis environments. In short,             cooltools             enables the effective use of the latest and largest genome folding datasets.},

  abstract = {The field of 3D genome organization produces large amounts of sequencing data from Hi-C and a rapidly-expanding set of other chromosome conformation protocols (3C+). Massive and heterogeneous 3C+ data require high-performance and flexible processing of sequenced reads into contact pairs. To meet these challenges, we present               pairtools               --a flexible suite of tools for contact extraction from sequencing data.               Pairtools               provides modular command-line interface (CLI) tools that can be flexibly chained into data processing pipelines. The core operations provided by               pairtools               are parsing of.sam alignments into Hi-C pairs, sorting and removal of PCR duplicates. In addition,               pairtools               provides auxiliary tools for building feature-rich 3C+ pipelines, including contact pair manipulation, filtration, and quality control. Benchmarking               pairtools               against popular 3C+ data pipelines shows advantages of               pairtools               for high-performance and flexible 3C+ analysis. Finally,               pairtools               provides protocol-specific tools for restriction-based protocols, haplotype-resolved contacts, and single-cell Hi-C. The combination of CLI tools and tight integration with Python data analysis libraries makes               pairtools               a versatile foundation for a broad range of 3C+ pipelines.},

We identify eight DNA motifs enriched at boundaries, including a motif bound by the M1BP protein, and two new boundary motifs. In contrast to mammals, the CTCF motif is only enriched on a small fraction of boundaries flanking inactive chromatin while most active boundaries contain the motifs bound by the M1BP or Beaf-32 proteins. We demonstrate that boundaries can be accurately predicted using only the motif sequences at open chromatin sites. We propose that DNA sequence guides the genome architecture by allocation of boundary proteins in the genome.

Low-salt swelling of isolated chromatin fibers or nuclei has been used for decades to investigate the structural properties of chromatin. But, visible changes in chromatin appearance have not been linked to known building blocks of genome structure or features along the genome sequence. We combine low-salt swelling of isolated nuclei with genome-wide chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) and imaging approaches to probe the effects of chromatin extension genome-wide. Photoconverted patterns on nuclei during expansion and contraction indicate that global genome structure is preserved after dramatic nuclear volume swelling, suggesting a highly elastic chromosome topology. Hi-C experiments before, during, and after nuclear swelling show changes in average contact probabilities at short length scales, reflecting the extension of the local chromatin fiber. But, surprisingly, during this large increase in nuclear volume, there is a striking maintenance of loops, TADs, active and inactive compartments, and chromosome territories. Subtle differences after expansion are observed, suggesting that the local chromatin state, protein interactions, and location in the nucleus can affect how strongly a given structure is maintained under stress. From these observations, we propose that genome topology is robust to extension of the chromatin fiber and isotropic shape change, and that this elasticity may be beneficial in physiological circumstances of changes in nuclear size and volume.},

  abstract = {Baboons (genus               Papio               ) are a morphologically and behaviorally diverse clade of catarrhine monkeys that have experienced hybridization between phenotypically and genetically distinct phylogenetic species. We used high-coverage whole-genome sequences from 225 wild baboons representing 19 geographic localities to investigate population genomics and interspecies gene flow. Our analyses provide an expanded picture of evolutionary reticulation among species and reveal patterns of population structure within and among species, including differential admixture among conspecific populations. We describe the first example of a baboon population with a genetic composition that is derived from three distinct lineages. The results reveal processes, both ancient and recent, that produced the observed mismatch between phylogenetic relationships based on matrilineal, patrilineal, and biparental inheritance. We also identified several candidate genes that may contribute to species-specific phenotypes.                        ,                             INTRODUCTION                                As a widespread but comparatively young clade of six parapatric species, the baboons (                 Papio                 sp.) exemplify a frequently observed pattern of mammalian diversity. In particular, they provide analogs for the population structure of the multibranched prehuman lineage that occupied a similar geographic range before the hegemony of ``modern'' humans,                 Homo sapiens                 . Despite phenotypic and genetic differences, interspecies hybridization has been described between baboons at several locations, and population relationships based on mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) do not correspond with relationships based on phenotype. These previous studies captured the broad outlines of baboon population genetic structure and evolutionary history but necessarily used data that were limited in genomic and geographical coverage and therefore could not adequately document inter- and intrapopulation variation. In this study, we analyzed whole-genome sequences of 225 baboons representing all six species and 19 geographic sites, with 18 local populations represented by multiple individuals.                                                        RATIONALE               Recent studies have identified several mammalian species groups in which genetically distinct lineages have hybridized to generate complex reticulate phylogenies. Baboons provide a valuable context for studying processes generating such population and phylogenetic complexity because extant parapatric species form hybrid zones in several regions of Africa, allowing for direct observation of ongoing introgression. Furthermore, prior studies of nuclear and mtDNA and phenotypic diversity have demonstrated gene flow among differentiated lineages but were unable to develop the detailed picture of process and history that is now possible using whole-genome sequences and modern computational methods. To address these questions, we designed a study that would provide a more fine-grained picture of recent and ancient genetic reticulation by comparing phenotypes and autosomal, X and Y chromosomal, and mtDNA sequences, along with polymorphic insertions of repetitive elements across multiple baboon populations.                                         RESULTS                                Using deep whole-genome sequence data from 225 baboons representing multiple populations, we identified several previously unknown geographic sites of gene flow between genetically distinct populations. We report that yellow baboons (                 P. cynocephalus                 ) from western Tanzania are the first nonhuman primate found to have received genetic input from three distinct lineages. We compared the ancestry shared among individuals, estimated separately from the X chromosome and autosomes, to distinguish shared ancestry due to ancestral population relationships from coancestry as a result of recent male-biased immigration and gene flow. This reveals directionality and sex bias of recent gene flow in several locations. Analyses of population differences within species quantified different degrees of interspecies introgression among populations with an essentially identical phenotype.                                                        CONCLUSION               The population genetic structure and history of introgression among baboon lineages are even more complex than predicted from observed phenotypic diversity and prior studies of limited genetic data. Single populations can carry genetic contributions from more than two ancestral sources. Populations that appear homogeneous on the basis of observable phenotype can display different levels of interspecies introgression. The evolutionary dynamics and current structure of baboon population diversity indicate that other mammals displaying differentiated and geographically separate species may also have more-complex histories than anticipated. This may also be true for the morphologically defined hominin taxa from the past 4 million years.                                                   Ancient and recent admixture among baboons: Complex population substructure and reticulation revealed by whole-genome sequencing.                   Pie charts represent recent ancestry of East African populations, with species contributions colored as in the inset map. Patterns of mixed ancestry differ substantially, even among conspecific populations. This suggests a complex history of recurrent interpopulational gene flow, driven predominantly by male migration. Comparably complex admixture probably also occurred among early hominins.},

How these changes influence homolog pairing, alignment, and recombination remain elusive. Using Hi-C, we systematically mapped 3D genome architecture throughout all meiotic prophase substages during mouse spermatogenesis. Our data uncover two major chromosome organizational features varying along the chromosome axis during early meiotic prophase, when homolog alignment occurs. First, transcriptionally active and inactive genomic regions form alternating domains consisting of shorter and longer chromatin loops, respectively. Second, the force-transmitting LINC complex promotes the alignment of ends of different chromosomes over a range of up to 20\% of chromosome length. Both features correlate with the pattern of homolog interactions and the distribution of recombination events. Collectively, our data reveal the influences of transcription and force on meiotic chromosome structure and suggest chromosome organization may provide an infrastructure for the modulation of meiotic recombination in higher eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: Fast and accurate quality control is essential for studies involving next-generation sequencing data. Whilst numerous tools exist to quantify QC metrics, there is no common approach to flexibly integrate these across tools and large sample sets. Assessing analysis results across an entire project can be time consuming and error prone; batch effects and outlier samples can easily be missed in the early stages of analysis.             Results: We present MultiQC, a tool to create a single report visualising output from multiple tools across many samples, enabling global trends and biases to be quickly identified. MultiQC can plot data from many common bioinformatics tools and is built to allow easy extension and customization.             Availability and implementation: MultiQC is available with an GNU GPLv3 license on GitHub, the Python Package Index and Bioconda. Documentation and example reports are available at http://multiqc.info             Contact: ~phil.ewels@scilifelab.se},

  abstract = {The process of assembling a species' reference genome may be performed in a number of iterations, with subsequent genome assemblies differing in the coordinates of mapped elements. The conversion of genome coordinates between different assemblies is required for many integrative and comparative studies. While currently a number of bioinformatics tools are available to accomplish this task, most of them are tailored towards the conversion of single genome coordinates. When converting the boundary positions of segments spanning larger genome regions, segments may be mapped into smaller sub-segments if the original segment's continuity is disrupted in the target assembly. Such a conversion may lead to a relevant degree of data loss in some circumstances such as copy number variation (CNV) analysis, where the quantitative representation of a genomic region takes precedence over base-specific accuracy.               segment\_liftover               aims at continuity-preserving remapping of genome segments between assemblies and provides features such as approximate locus conversion, automated batch processing and comprehensive logging to facilitate processing of datasets containing large numbers of structural genome variation data.},
