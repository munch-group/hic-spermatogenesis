## Methods

In this project, we formulate two objectives: 

**A**: Reproduce the Hi-C interaction maps and eigendecomposition from [@wang_reprogramming_2019], with some modifications. We briefly use *HiCExplorer*, but change the analyses to use the *Open2C Ecosystem* [@open2c] which have a Pyton API as well as command-line functions, which can be paired very well with Jupyter Notebooks. The majority of the data analysis was run with a *gwf* workflow, and the commands that were visually inspected were run in Jupyter Notebooks. 

**B** Compare with regions of selection that are found in *papio anubis*, and maybe in *human* too. Investigate the biological meaning of the results.
